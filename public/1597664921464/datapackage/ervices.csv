46,612611049847328,"Hypothermia Program",,1187372282686349,"For more than 20 years The Father McKenna Center has responded to the needs of men without a home for a safe and predictable environment during the cold nights of winter. While DC has a Hypothermia Hotline, many of our guests do not feel safe in emergency shelter environments, and there is not support for their transition through homelessness, only maintenance of their status quo.

Our Hypothermia/Transition Program is application based, and each applicant meets with his Case Manager to ensure commitment to the goals and structure of the Program. Men are approved for participation in the Program based on an assessment of their readiness to move toward the next step on their journey out of homelessness, whether that step is a job, a temporary or permanent housing situation, or stability on the road to sobriety or mental health.

We open on November 1st and operate every night until March 31. The Hypothermia/Transition Program offers the men shelter for the night, a shower, a home-cooked evening meal, and time to work on their personal plan or to socialize.

The Program has two exceptional characteristics: it builds a cohort and it reintroduces family interactions.

Each year we provide shelter for a consistent group of 18-20 men. This is not a drop-in program, rather the same men join us each night until they find stable housing or reunite with their community. This opportunity to build a bond of trust in a predictable environment cannot be underestimated. The state of homelessness is characterized by chaos and, too often, by fear. We believe the Hypothermia/Transition Program offers a place of not just physical shelter. It also provides a mental and emotional place of safety that allows each man to focus on moving his life forward.

The success of the Hypothermia/Transition Program is made possible by the consistent and loving support of the Gonzaga Mothers’ Club (GMC). Each season, the GMC and their families commit to cooking and serving the evening meal for 20 men for over 150 nights! Even more remarkable, this is not simply a drop-off service.

Our Workforce Development Program is a holistic, intensive, and highly personalized approach to preparing adults to enter the workforce and advance in their careers. As with all our efforts to end poverty, our workforce readiness programming is rooted in the power of connections. Partnerships with community employers are key to connecting job seekers with jobs and area businesses with excellent staff members.

Boot Camps and Workshops

DSC_0242 cropOur intensive, 40-hour Boot Camp combines career planning with the “soft skills” that employers seek. Topics include goal setting, conflict resolution, and phone etiquette, as well as hands-on support and practice with resume writing, cover letters, and interviewing. Following the Boot Camp, each job seeker is paired with a job coach from the community.

Boot Camp workshops are held six times a year at A Wider Circle’s Professional Development Center

For job seekers who cannot attend our Boot Camp (and for Boot Camp graduates who would like a refresher), we offer workshops and one-to-one job search assistance appointments during which participants get personalized attention from volunteers.

Imagining healing is one of the most challenging tasks asked of a survivor. The word itself conjures the visual of a spinning turntable as one navigates feelings of hopelessness, shame, anger, fear, doubt and anxiety. The wreckage caused by trauma can easily overwhelm and paralyze us, making us feel stuck and keeping us in crisis.

DCRCC is committed to the belief that everyone can heal from trauma. We work to preserve individual agency in one’s healing. We seek to build a hub of resources to enable individuals to have more models and greater access to tools and support. The premise of ‘There is No Straight Path’ is to reframe healing as gathering tools and developing skills that begin to restore a sense of power and control. We offer the insight that healing is not a linear path but rather a spiral of resiliency. Like a winding labyrinth, the trials of regaining connection, battling loneliness, managing frustration, building trust, practicing self love and finding hope line a spiral circling outward as we emerge with new insights and more resources",728145736382163,http://dcrcc.org/counseling/no-straight-path/,alindamood@dcrcc.org,Verified,"878986697513222,637158405241810","Email or call for more information.",,,,,819440187923797,,,,782477248679291,,,,,2020-07-16T14:29:17.000000Z,2020-07-16T14:29:17.000000Z

Individuals served by the public mental health system are dying, on average, 25 years earlier than the general population. This is largely due to chronic health conditions such as diabetes, hypertension, cancers, and other obesity- and smoking-related diseases. These illnesses are worsened by years of malnutrition, living out in the harsh elements, and limited access to preventive health care. Pathways to Housing DC originated as a mental health and substance abuse provider. We have grown our partnerships with primary care providers and other local nonprofits over the past few years, recognizing that physical health and mental health are inextricably linked. We are committed to growing life expectancy and improving the health of the individuals we serve.

Timely access to healthcare and health education greatly impact an individual’s ability to recover, live longer, and maintain a healthy lifestyle. We currently provide integrated mental health and primary care services to all Pathways clients through an on-site, walk-in clinic via our partnership with Unity Health Care (the District’s largest Federally Qualified Health Center). The program has impacted the lives of the people we serve by increasing their awareness of, and adherence to, healthy behaviors and independence in managing their healthcare needs. We have seen an increase in the number of preventive care visits, a decrease in emergency department visits, an increase in the percentage of clients linked to primary care providers, an increase in adherence to diabetes management and regular lab work for clients with diabetes and pre-diabetes, an increase in adherence to follow-up medical appointments and medication, an increase in healthy eating, an increase in social support and a decrease in substance use.

Ultimately, our goal is to ensure that the people we serve are empowered and able to live longer, healthier and more hopeful lives.",743353111808252,https://pathwaystohousingdc.org/what-we-do/integrated-health/,,Verified,941516382466411,"Call to make an appointment.

We offer drug and alcohol-free residential settings that use the influence of the community consisting of treatment staff and those in recovery, as key agents of change.

In addition to using the concept of community as treatment method, the TC employs the principle of “self-help.” Self-help implies that the individuals in treatment are the main contributors to the change process. “Mutual self-help” means that individuals also assume partial responsibility for the recovery of their peers – an important aspect of an individual’s own treatment. The stages of treatment reflect increased levels of personal and social responsibility. We use a variety of group processes to help individuals learn and assimilate social values and develop more effective social skills.

Our TC is centered on cultural values. Recognizing that a client’s culture is an inseparable part of his or her self-image, we provide clients information to combat what Dr. Carter G. Woodson* described as the “mis-education” that has shaped their lives. This information is vital in helping clients to clarify who they are and to place themselves as worthy citizens.

The Project was named for its founding Director, Barbara McDowell, after her untimely death.

The Project not only litigates appeals on behalf of Legal Aid clients but also files “friend of the court” briefs on cases involving matters of importance to people living in poverty. Beyond litigation, the Project provides appellate instruction, consultation, and advice to the larger D.C. legal services community. Although most of the Project’s work involves cases before the District’s highest court – the District of Columbia Court of Appeals – the Project also gets involved in administrative appeals and cases before the District of Columbia Superior Court and the federal courts.

Learn more about Barbara McDowell, the renowned appellate litigator and U.S. Supreme Court advocate who served as the project’s first director and after whom our appellate advocacy project is named.

After Barbara’s untimely death, Legal Aid created the Barbara McDowell Endowment Fund for Appellate Litigation with funds donated both from Barbara’s estate and from the generous donations of her husband, Jerry Hartman. The Fund was created “to honor the immeasurable contributions that Barbara made to Legal Aid and the legal needs of persons living in poverty in the District of Columbia.” Jerry has continued to donate generously in Barbara’s honor to the Fund to sustain the ongoing, important work of The Barbara McDowell Appellate Advocacy Project. Jerry also founded The Barbara McDowell and Gerald S. Hartman Foundation, which supports organizations that undertake systemic litigation on behalf of disadvantaged persons and groups throughout the United States.","768639914164498,1052799655566995",https://www.legalaiddc.org/appellate-advocacy/,,Verified,917725171609009,"You can apply online or utilize walk-in intake hours.

And being a poor older adult in Washington DC is a huge challenge, largely because of the price of rentals in the city. In addition, Hispanic older adults never knew about the social benefits offered by the federal or city government, and even when they know there is some benefit, it is difficult for them to apply for the benefit because they cannot read the documents that They explain the benefits, cannot fill out the forms, or do not know how to follow those procedures. To face this tangle of procedures, Vida has a Social Services Counselor. All participants of Vida Senior Centers receive help from our counselors to apply for affordable housing, transportation and social benefits for programs that benefit older adults. With regard to immigration procedures, VIDA not only helps participants to start and follow-up on their migration processes, but also offers a weekly “Citizenship Class” in which participants are prepared to take the Citizenship exam. We also connect them with the agencies that help them file their taxes and file legal procedures, if necessary. Likewise, VIDA is an official distributor of boxes of the Food Bank, and with this it helps to identify older adults at greater risk. So, in summary, when it comes to social services:

We recognize how challenging a child’s illness can be for the entire family, especially when parents cannot see what’s wrong. Mental illness and psychiatric conditions are particularly complex because there are many factors that may influence your child’s emotions and behaviors. As well, the signs and symptoms of a psychiatric condition are often different between younger children and teens.

Our multidisciplinary team is composed of pediatric psychiatrists, nurses, social workers, academic counselors, psychologists, and expressive (art) therapists, who see to all aspects of care. They have extensive experience in the specialized care and treatment of children and teens with complicated emotional and behavioral disturbances.

The inpatient unit was specifically designed to meet the developmental and psychiatric needs of children and adolescents. We offer two separate programs to meet the distinct medical needs of children and teens — a 12-bed unit for patients aged 2-12 and a 14-bed unit for those aged 13-17.

The Representative Payee then helps the client to budget the money and disburses the funds to pay for current needs, including housing and utilities, food, medical expenses, personal care and clothing. The Representative Payee must keep records of how the client’s money is spent. This information is reported regularly to the Social Security Administration or to the Office of Personnel Management.

To do this, VIDA has a licensed nutritionist / dietitian who supervises the food services of our participants. Our nutritionist also offers nutritional and diet counseling individually and in groups. The nutritionist works in coordination with the Health Promotion Counselor to put emphasis on people with high risk of diabetes and high blood pressure. Individual and group counseling are done with the objective of helping participants establish a healthy diet, by promoting informed decisions regarding their food. It is always emphasized that a healthy diet helps prevent and manage chronic diseases such as diabetes, hypertension and obesity. In addition to the classes, the nutritionist also offers demonstrates of healthy cooking. Depending on the season and seasonal vegetables or fruits, healthy meals are prepared. The nutritionist regularly uses food from the Food Bank box so that we teach participants how to use those ingredients in the healthiest way possible. Participants are also educated on important issues related to nutrition such as: learning to keep food in good condition; modify recipes to make them healthier; improve decisions when buying food; use healthy portions of meals; and pay attention to their weight. They are often reminded of the importance of having breakfast and not skipping meals to avoid spikes and drops in sugar levels. In addition to that, VIDA gives breakfast to 50 participants in our two centers. We do not have a subsidy to provide breakfast, but for the past year VIDA has obtained private donations of bread and cereals that allow us to deliver breakfast in the morning to 50 people. In addition, we offer free lunch to about 120 people daily. Thanks to the support of the Washington DC Department of Aging, we deliver around 120 hot lunches daily between our two centers, Monday through Friday. Additionally, Vida Senior Center is an official distributor of the city's Food Bank, with which we distribute to each participant one meal box per month. In summary, nutrition and food activities are as follows:

• Free light breakfast: coffee / tea and bread or oatmeal
• Free lunches
• Individual nutrition assessments
• Individual diet tracking
• Group classes on nutrition
• Healthy food demonstrations
• Monthly distribution of a Food Bank box

Weekly sessions provide youth and their families the space to process their experiences and discover their innate resilience.

Resilient Scholars Project – School Based (RSP-SB) Services

RSP-SB Services are grounded in evidence-based treatment models such as trauma-focused cognitive behavioral therapy (TF-CBT), play therapy, and mindfulness. The program empowers children and adolescents by highlighting their existing strength.  Throughout the school year, RSP clinicians facilitate group and individual therapy services using games, art, experiential activities, writing, and other modalities that explain concepts to participants in developmentally appropriate ways.  As part of RSP-SB Services, RSP clinicians also provide trainings to partner staff on incorporating trauma and bereavement informed practices into their environments. 

Resilient Scholars Project – Home Based (RSP-HB) Services

RSP-HB Services are designed to supplement RSP-SB Services by engaging entire families in the treatment process.  Using the trauma adapted family connections (TA-FC) model, RSP clinicians also aim to help families improve access to needed resources, increase safety skills, reduce youth absenteeism from school, and/or improve youth grades over a period of six months.  RSP clinicians build on the treatment models used in RSP-SB Services by incorporating principles from narrative therapy, motivational interviewing, and family systems therapy to work toward goals established with each family.  By participating in activities, games, and conversations that help families learn about trauma/loss, families also work toward improving communication and family cohesion.","1108850981657232,1166799153375505",https://www.wendtcenter.org/c-h-i-l-d-resilient-scholars/,,Verified,,"To become a client, please call: 202.204.5021",,,,,714080995184693,789043683491652,,,"1231165117410316,622488765022102",,,,,2020-07-16T14:30:36.000000Z,2020-07-16T14:30:36.000000Z

As part of the Health Promotion program, our counselors routinely check the participants who register daily: their pressure is measured; their blood sugar levels are monitored; and their vital signs are supervised. Due to the high preparation of our counselors, when it is detected that the participant requires a medical appointment, the participants are referred to an appointment with their primary doctor or the needed specialist, if the case requires so. VIDA works with 7 hospitals in the city to which our counselors refer the participants when necessary. If the participant needs it, our social service counselor helps the participant to make the medical appointment. Sometimes the language barriers require this type of support. We also have a medication monitoring program to teach participants to know the benefits and side effects of the medications they take, so that they can understand the impact of their medications and identify if there is a problem. As part of the “Medication Monitoring Program”, a personalized follow-up of each person who enrolls in the program is carried out and a medication organizer pill is provided free of charge, so that they learn to take their medications on time and also learn to realize when they forget to take their pills.

Mood disorders can have wide-ranging effects on children, teens and their families. The toll on their physical health, performance in school, family and social relationships and overall well-being can be devastating.

Helping Children and Teens with Mood Disorders
The Mood Disorders Program at Children’s National Health System is dedicated to helping children and teens with mood disorders live as happily and healthfully as possible. We personalize care for each patient and family to ensure children receive the most appropriate treatment with the best outcomes.

Features of our program include:

Expert pediatric specialists. When a child or teen’s negative feelings don’t go away, our highly trained pediatric specialists have the expertise and experience to recognize mood disorders and provide the care they need. That includes pediatricians, counselors, social workers, psychiatrists and others.
Family-centered care. Our multi-specialty team knows that you know your child best. We value your input and work closely with your family to include you as a part of your child’s care team. This ensures he or she receives the most comprehensive and individualized care.
Ongoing support and education. We strive to empower preteens and their families diagnosed with mild to moderate depression to learn about the disorder that is impacting their lives. Group sessions that include art therapy and other tools help you work together toward recovery and wellness.
Finding new ways to help. Learning more about the factors that can lead to depression and other mood disorders in school-age children can improve their treatments and outcomes. Our researchers are committed to discovering new ways to identify, prevent and treat these disorders. Some of our patients participate in clinical trials. You can find out more by speaking with your child’s doctor, nurse, or other care team member.
Conditions We Treat
At Children’s National, we treat a wide range of mood disorders, including:

Major depression. A serious condition that involves persistent sadness, hopelessness and other symptoms
Bipolar disorder. A type of depression that also includes severe mood changes to extreme elation and happiness
Dysthymic disorder. Depression that is less severe but more long-lasting than major depression
Anxiety disorder. Excessive worry that doesn’t get better and can interfere with daily activities
Children and teens with mood disorders may have:

Difficult relationships with family and friends
Trouble sleeping
Changes in eating patterns or weight
Extreme temper outbursts
Low energy
Poor concentration
Aggressive behaviors
Mood disorders can cause other symptoms as well. Parents are in a unique position to see behavior changes and problems in their children. We take your concerns seriously and listen carefully to your observations.

Services We Offer
We start with a thorough evaluation, which can last two sessions or more, depending on your needs. Your pediatric specialist will talk with you about your child’s symptoms, your family health history and any other psychological concerns you may have. To give us more details about your child’s condition, we may ask your family to fill out forms known as objective scales. In some cases, teachers are also asked to complete these scales.

With an accurate diagnosis, we design a specific plan to provide the best care for each child. Follow-up care may involve:

Individual therapy
Family therapy
Medication, when necessary
We want you to be confident in your child’s care. To that end, we also provide second opinion evaluations and consultations.",1282604214927911,https://childrensnational.org/departments/mood-disorders-program,,,941516382466411,"We see children and teenagers from the Washington, D.C., metropolitan region and across the nation.

329,810358604812792,"Behavioral & Mental Health",,1168436736852155,"When aging, it is sometimes inevitable that older adults have a life without much company. Sometimes this happens because of their children have other responsibilities as parents and have to take care of their own families. Also, in the case of older adults who are immigrants, when getting older they are disconnected from their networks and family members in their country of origin. In many cases, this isolation ends up generating chronic episodes of depression. Likewise, the life of the elderly is usually accompanied by many economic concerns, especially when it comes to immigrants with limited resources, who did not accumulate a sufficient pension to meet their basic needs. Not being able to pay the house bills or the costs of their health bills generates a lot of anxiety. In the case of most of our participants, who are first-generation immigrants, linguistic isolation is added to all of the above. Feeling that they cannot communicate well with the society that surrounds them or that they cannot function as they normally do is a very common stress generator in immigrants. To handle these situations, VIDA offers daily individual counseling and group counseling aimed at training older adults to manage stress and anxiety. We try to break the taboo barrier and understand that we all are exposed to situations of anxiety and that in the midst of problems, we must have tactics that help us relieve tensions. And to complement group and individual counseling, Vida also offers daily Tai-chi exercise classes, in which older adults learn to breathe and relax the tensions that manifest in their body. Vida Senior Centers puts special emphasis on mental health, because this can trigger other effects on the well-being of the person. When the situation requires the intervention of a doctor, Vida Senior Centers refers the participant to a specialized center. For this, VIDA has been coordinating with several local organizations specialized in mental health medical treatments. In summary, the activities offered as part of our Mental Health program are as follows:

• Individual counseling to handle stress situations
• Group counseling on frustration management techniques
• Tai-Chi exercises to learn to breathe and relax the body
• Classes on Positive Thinking
• Classes on Mental and Emotional Health
• Referral to doctors if the need is identified","646558365152210,632725434790464",http://box2142.temp.domains/~vidasen1/behavioral-mental-health/,,Verified,941516382466411,"Call to join the center.",,,,,1147869714969920,592146566922528,,"1295679372454826,854808174954754","990219526768898,620565499902964",,,,,2020-07-16T14:31:07.000000Z,2020-07-16T14:31:07.000000Z

These older neighbors are unable to play an active role in society because of their homebound status, which results in them becoming ""invisible"" and, consequently, this all too often leads to situations in which they are taken advantage of because of their decreased mobility and limited support network.

Project HELP utilizes a full-time staff attorney, para-professional support, volunteers, and a cadre of volunteer (pro bono) attorneys from private law firms and government organizations.

- Interview clients at home regarding legal problems;
- Draft or review legal documents that seniors may need, such as powers of attorney or wills;
- Administer a public-benefits checkup;
- Assist clients with securing and maintaining public benefits such as Social Security, Supplemental Security Income (SSI), Medicaid, Elderly and Persons with Physical Disabilities (EPD) Waiver, Medicare, Qualified Medicare Beneficiary (QMB) and Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) benefits.
- Assist clients whose benefits or services have been threatened with termination, terminated, decreased or overpaid, through representation at all stages of the appeal process including personal conferences, requests for reconsideration, and fair hearings before the Office of Administrative Hearings (OAH). 
- Analyze their housing situation concerning any landlord problems or consumer problems or, in the case of homeowners, any problems with home repair, predatory lending or deed fraud;
- Ensure proper follow-up on the identified legal problems either directly or via LCE’s other program initiatives.

Volunteers
We are always looking for volunteers! We have a special need for attorneys and notaries, but anyone can volunteer to serve as a witness when we finalize important documents in seniors' homes.

Our staff often gives training presentations on basic estate planning at area law firms. Please let us know if you are interested in hosting a training session.
If you are a notary licensed in the District of Columbia, please consider volunteering to help our clients execute important documents.

Our short-term program (up to 21 days) provides emergency shelter to homeless and runaway youth, ages 12-17. LAYC recruits and trains English and Spanish-speaking individuals and families as host families to provide youth with safe, loving, and stable homes. As part of this program, biological families receive family preservation services.

FAMILY PRESERVATION (SHORT-TERM ONLY)
The goal of family preservation is to reunite youth with their families. Our staff makes every effort to mediate temporary conflicts that do not pose a long-term threat to the youth’s safety. Our staff provides in-home family counseling, parent skills development, and mental health treatment to youth. We work with families who may be experiencing difficulties with adolescent behavior problems and mental health concerns as well as the effects of abuse or neglect, trauma, and poverty. We typically work with the families of youth at risk of running away or who have run away and are housed with one of our host families for five weeks.

LONG-TERM (UP TO 18 MONTHS)
Our long-term program helps older homeless youth, 18-21, transition to adulthood in a loving home. Once a youth is placed in the home of a certified family, the program provides supportive services to the youth, the host family, and the youth’s biological family.

We provide trauma interventions, mindfulness and art therapy to help improve outcomes in the clients we serve. Patients can achieve a lasting recovery with support from peers and a highly trained staff.

Intensive Outpatient & Partial Hospitalization Program
Both the IOP & PHP programs offer a structured daily schedule consisting of evidence-based group therapy and a variety of hands-on art therapy, recreation and expressive activities. We help adults experiencing mental health conditions such as PTSD, depression, bipolar diagnoses, or anxiety return to a healthy daily routine that incorporates self-care, social interaction, and mindfulness.

The Partial Hospitalization Program provides an intense, structured treatment setting for individuals who would benefit from daily therapeutic interventions or who would otherwise require inpatient psychiatric care.

Intensive Outpatient Treatment (IOP)
Intensive Outpatient clients come to the PIW Day Center from 9:00 am to 12:30 pm three days a week for psychiatric services and group therapy sessions. While multiple groups are offered licensed clinicians work with each IOP client to develop an individualized treatment plan based on the client’s strengths, diagnosis and identified opportunities for growth and skill building.

During treatment, patients generally attend 3 groups a day and receive other individualized care provided by licensed clinicians and a psychiatrist in accordance with the client’s treatment plan.

Partial Hospitalization Treatment (PHP)
The Partial Hospitalization Program runs five days per week, five hours each day 9:00am to 2:00pm, plus a 30 minute lunch break.  Each day:

Begins with a community meeting group to review the daily schedule
Welcomes any new individuals
Reviews progress on treatment goals
Addresses any concerns or challenges
During treatment, patients generally attend 4 groups a day and receive other individualized care provided by licensed clinicians and a psychiatrist in accordance with the patient’s treatment plan.

Trauma Recovery & Empowerment Model
The Day Center at PIW utilizes an evidence based approach called The Trauma Recovery and Empowerment Model (TREM). TREM is a fully manualized, group-based intervention designed to facilitate trauma recovery among women with histories of exposure to sexual, emotional and physical abuse. Drawing on cognitive restructuring, psychoeducational, and skills-training techniques, the intervention emphasizes the development of coping skills and social support. It addresses both short-term and long-term consequences of violent victimization and neglect, including mental health symptoms, such as posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), depression, and substance abuse.

Mindfulness
The Day Center at PIW utilizes the practice of Mindfulness to support clients in their healing. Mindfulness is an integrative, mind-body based approach that helps people to manage their thoughts, feelings and mental health. It has become widely used in a range of contexts to support emotional health and awareness.

Mindfulness exercises are ways of paying attention to the present moment, using techniques like meditation, breathing, and yoga. Training helps people to become more aware of their thoughts, feelings and body sensations so that instead of being overwhelmed by them, they are better able to manage them. Practicing mindfulness can give more insight into emotions, boost attention and concentration as well as improve relationships.",1289140698414142,https://psychinstitute.com/treatment-services/adults/the-day-center/,,Verified,"637158405241810,941516382466411","PIW’s Day Center Program has evidence-based treatment and skill enhancement to improve a person’s ability to function in daily life.

In 2018, our outreach teams served 1,872 unduplicated people over with 12,428 individual face-to-face contacts. Our teams completed thousands of housing assessments, helped hundreds of people obtain vital documents required as prerequisites for housing, and connected hundreds more to mental and physical healthcare services.

Then, they partner with each individual to access housing, employment, medical care, mental health care, substance abuse treatment, and other services. Additionally, our nurse practitioner and psychiatrist conduct street visits to engage people with complex health needs who are not connected to other health services.

A good education is fundamental to achieving financial independence as well as a successful career.

Our curriculum focuses on the mastery of subject matter tested during the GED exam- Science, Social Studies, Mathematics, and Language Arts.  Our experienced and compassionate teachers and volunteers work closely with youth, offering one-on-one tutoring and mentoring to ensure confidence and educational success.

Covenant House provides youth with transportation assistance to and from our Community Service Center as well as well as meals and childcare (for youth who are eligible) to help alleviate barriers to attending classes.

Covenant House Washington’s Job Readiness Career Center (JCRC) helps young people gain skills in a specific vocation and also learn what they need to know about job hunting and the professional world.  Skills taught to young people include:

Interviewing
Resume Building
Workplace Ethics & Behavior
Proper Workplace Attire
Computer Skills
Networking
Effective Communication
Helping our youth find jobs is the most important step to ensuring their financial independence and future success.  Our staff are sensitive to the fears that young people experience when it comes to looking for employment and handling the responsibility that keeping a job requires. They know that not all the answers can be found in a classroom or a textbook, so they make themselves available to youth by listening to their concerns and offering reassurance.

They also know that they can take a much needed break while their older family member is at the Center. Our families regularly tell us how grateful and relieved they feel once their loved one is attending Misler. The respite from their own caregiving responsibilities means that they will be better able to provide needed care at home.

Social work staff also supports caregivers through their knowledge of community resources to help families with their caregiving responsibilities. Whether it is a referral to a community based professional such as a neurologist, or a roster of credible home care agencies, we are there to help you meet the needs of your loved ones, today and in the future. We draw on the resources of JCA programs such as the Senior HelpLine or Connect-A-Ride Information and Referral to link families to the services they need.

We represent domestic violence survivors seeking to obtain civil protective orders against their abusers. As of 2012, we maintain a presence at both Domestic Violence Intake Centers in D.C. (in N.W. at the courthouse, and in S.E. at United Medical Center) to increase access to our services and to provide critical same-day assistance to clients.

We also represent clients in custody and divorce matters, seeking to achieve just outcomes that improve the lives of families and children in poverty. And we represent clients in child support cases, where we strive to ensure fair and accurate child support orders — support that is often vital to a child’s well-being. In 2011, we established an office at the D.C. Superior Court’s Paternity and Child Support Branch to help custodial and non-custodial parents navigate the daunting child support system. We are able to help hundreds of individuals every year as a result.

In addition to providing direct client representation, we have continued to focus on our systemic efforts around these issue areas. Our domestic violence/family law attorneys actively participate in efforts to increase collaboration and improve services to domestic violence survivors, serving on many committees with other advocates in the District. We also strive to transform the operations of the child support court, as well as participate in meetings with other service agencies and stakeholders in the community to address emerging issues and trends.","956369396938800,956135951962872",https://www.legalaiddc.org/dvfamily-law/,,Verified,917725171609009,"You can apply online or utilize walk-in intake hours.

This abuse can be physical, verbal or emotional. It can have devastating effects on the child. In some cases children who are bullied try to commit suicide.

While bullying can happen at any age, it’s more likely to occur among school children. Both those who are bullied and those who bully others can have serious health problems as a result.

The Program for Health Problems Related to Bullying at Children’s National Health System offers professional evaluation and treatment for children and teens affected physically or mentally by bullying.

We are passionately committed to improving the lives of these children. In addition, we’re dedicated to prevention and we work hard in the community to inform the public about bullying and the health risks it causes.

Program Medical Director Jorge C. Srabstein, M.D., has testified on Capitol Hill about the connection between bullying and public health problems in our society.

Each year we welcome young people from colleges, schools, parishes, and other programs who not only serve as volunteers, but also live at The Father McKenna Center for a week at a time. This program is often an Alternative Spring Break or an Outreach Program for students who come to the Center on Saturday or Sunday, and stay through the following weekend.

Our volunteers are not bystanders, rather they eat their meals in common with the men we serve, work in the Center, and support all aspects of our program. They sleep in the program area in the former church basement (often on pews or air mattresses they bring), take time to reflect on their experiences of service, and often have supplementary learning experiences at other organizations that support people experiencing homelessness (e.g. The Washington Legal Clinic for the Homeless). The week of service frequently culminates in a day of advocacy as our visitors meet with their representatives or staff in the US Congress – just steps away from The Father McKenna Center.

We believe the experience of immersive service plays a vital role in breaking down societal barriers, teaches about individuals as well as issues, and equips our young visitors with tools for compassionate engagement as they return to their own communities.

As one of the few Medication Assisted Therapy (MAT) treatment providers in Washington, DC, Andromeda is uniquely positioned to provide MAT for opioid dependent persons with unmet treatment needs for substance use and co-occurring mental health disorders.

Andromeda’s staff has decades of experience in working with persons with opioid dependence. Staff provides a safe space, inclusive of empathy for the consequences of addiction.

They also refer patients to the array of educational health and social services that are available in the DC metro area.

Andromeda patients that have been in the program have turned their lives around, working, living free of drugs and reestablishing healthy relationships.
