Research
ACTS supports investigations that continually improve team science, integrating multiple disciplines across the full translational science spectrum: from population based and policy research, through patient oriented and human subject clinical research, to basic discovery.

Through meetings, publications, and collaborative efforts, ACTS will provide a forum for members to develop, implement, and evaluate the impact of research education programs.

Advocacy
ACTS provides a strong voice to advocate for translational science, clinical research, patient oriented research, and research education support. We will engage at the local, state, and federal levels and coordinate efforts with other professional organizations.

Our History
The Elaine Ellis Center of Health was founded in 2010 by the relatives of the late Elaine Ellis, who lost her battle with cancer in 1993.
She was the matriarch of her family and a vibrant presence in her community. Her kindness and passion to serve others who were less fortunate extended beyond her family and friends to anyone who was in need of food, shelter, advice, and good conversation. Though she is unable to see the fruit which her character produced, her legacy continues, and is the driving force behind the Center&rsquo;s mission to serve others.

Mission Stament
Elaine Ellis Center of Health (EECH) is a Not-For-Profit Organization dedicated to providing affordable comprehensive, preventive, and primary healthcare services to individuals residing in public housing and the surrounding areas, regardless of their ability to pay.

We mobilize skilled and unskilled volunteers, invest financial resources, and, through our work together, transform people and properties. Our mission is rooted in the Jewish commitment to seek justice by engaging in acts of loving kindness. We welcome people of all faiths to share in our work to keep our communities diverse and vital.

Yachad continues to have a big impact twenty years later&mdash;by staying true to our original mission to preserve housing in DC and engage the Jewish and greater community in social justice work. We do this through partnerships with homeowners in our Single Family Home Repair Program. This program brings skilled workers and volunteer groups into area homes. Over the course of many months, a home's plumbing, electrical, drywall, and other infrastructure repairs are made. Yachad requires homeowners to participate in our Homeowner Education Workshops to learn home maintenance and financial planning skills. Many of Yachad's volunteers participate in Sukkot in Spring, a program in which synagogues and other Jewish community groups make repairs in a home alongside the homeowners.

Other volunteers throughout the year include semi-skilled volunteers through the Handymensch Program and skilled workers who donate money and/or services through Yachad's Neighbor to Neighbor Initiative. Families or groups of friends may also celebrate a special occasion by hosting a Mitzvah Party, in which they sponsor and participate in a home repair project. Over the summer, high school students participate in Yachad's Ramp it Up! program in which campers build an accessibility ramp for an individual with disabilities.

Additionally, Yachad's Faith to Faith Community Development Program brings together real estate professionals to provide expertise to community development projects by working in partnership with houses of worship and other nonprofits to renovate their community facilities to better serve the congregants and neighborhood residents.",info@yachad-dc.org,http://yachad-dc.org/,,,,

Legal Assistance We Provide to Tenants and/or Tenant Associations
- Eviction defense: if you received a “Notice to Vacate” and or a court summons from your landlord for issues like breach of lease or non-payment of rent, we can help you defend against eviction;
- Rent control disputes: we help you get the correct rent level under rent control, by helping you file forms and filing, defending against, rent control related petitions;
- Government subsidies: we help you prevent loss of your housing subsidy, including filing required paperwork for Section 8 vouchers, public housing and site-based subsidized housing;
- Repairs: we advocate for your right to live in a safe, well-maintained apartment, and to a rent credit for enduring those conditions;
- Reasonable accommodations: if you have a disability and need an accommodation to live in your apartment more comfortably, we can advocate for your apartment to better meet your needs;
- Tenant Opportunity to Purchase Act: we work with tenants and tenants’ associations to help them exercise their right of first refusal of the purchase of their home, and to negotiate benefits in exchange for their right to purchase;
- Outreach and Education: we are glad to speak with community members about tenants’ rights and the rights of elderly tenants;
Policy advocacy to improve community responsiveness to elderly tenants, enhance affordable housing creation and preservation resources, and ensure accommodations for elderly tenants.

Social Work and Volunteer Assistance
- Assessment: of your full needs to ensure you are getting all of the services you need;
- Referrals: for services like meals, housekeeping and money management;
- Health care advocacy: we link tenants with medical service providers, home health care, and community social work referrals, for long-term health and case management;
- Volunteer coordination for tenants at risk of eviction for issues related to housekeeping or having too many possessions in the unit, we engage volunteers where appropriate;
- Counseling of clients who experience grief, loss and other mental health challenges to remaining housed.

We welcome referrals from community agencies, property managers and other community members, upon signs of eviction risks, like:
- A lapse in payment of rent
- Unpaid utilities
- Housekeeping or hoarding concerns; and/or
- Memory loss of the tenant that causes neglect of obligations that the tenant followed previously.",d9ithub@gmail.com,,,,,
